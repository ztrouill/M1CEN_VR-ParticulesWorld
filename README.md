Particules'World is a virtual reality experience developed for Google Cardboard as part of an initiation course to virtual reality.	

It's a contemplative and dreamlike work offering a break from the real world, immersing the viewer in a world of abstract visual creations.

The music was made by Antoine Pittionni in accordance with the animations.	

With : Antoine Pittilonni, Marie Bardelot, Lauria Alaoua et Artem Arutiunian
